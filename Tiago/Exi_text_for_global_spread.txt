The growth and spread of these variants seems linked to the severity of lockdown measures. 
After weeks of contained spread, the UK variant's worldwide presence exploded, increasing its presence sevenfold over the course of late December. This is indicative of the increased travel and exposure during this time, but is also a consequence of the increeased transmissability of this strain.



The Brazillian and South African variants show similar growth to each other (roughly 3.5 new countries per week), despite the Brazillian strain spreading earlier.
